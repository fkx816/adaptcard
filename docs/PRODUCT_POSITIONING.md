# Product Positioning - adaptcard

## One-line positioning

adaptcard is an open learning engine for adaptive practice, not just a flashcard app.

## Positioning statement

For learners, educators, and builders who need long-term retention, adaptcard provides a general-purpose learning engine that combines spaced repetition scheduling and dynamic assessment generation, so any knowledge domain can run adaptive review loops.

## Who it serves

- Self-learners: languages, certifications, interview prep
- Students: school subjects and exam tracks
- Teams: internal training and onboarding knowledge
- Developers: build custom learning products on top of the engine

## What makes it general-purpose

- Domain-agnostic knowledge point model
- Pluggable question strategies (recall, MCQ, cloze, scenario)
- Pluggable AI providers (local/cloud)
- API-first design for embedding into other products
- Configurable scoring and scheduling policies

## Messaging pillars

1. Open learning engine, not a fixed app
2. Knowledge points are reusable assets
3. Adaptive practice from real performance
4. Local-first AI support for privacy and control
5. Production-friendly backend for education products

## Language guide

Use:
- "open learning engine"
- "adaptive practice infrastructure"
- "knowledge-point graph"
- "API-first learning core"

Avoid over-narrow wording:
- "just flashcards"
- "vocabulary-only tool"
- "single-subject memorizer"

## Competitive framing

Relative to static flashcard tools:
- dynamic generated assessments
- broader question strategy support
- easier embedding into custom workflows

Relative to full LMS platforms:
- focused and composable learning core
- simpler integration and lighter operations

## Near-term packaging checklist

- Keep project name as `adaptcard` while branding as "Open Learning Engine"
- Align README subtitle and feature bullets to general-purpose language
- Add API examples for non-language domains
- Add roadmap tracks for developer platform use cases
